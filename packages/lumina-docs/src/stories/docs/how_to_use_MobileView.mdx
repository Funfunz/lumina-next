# How to use Mobile View

## Mobile View Button Location

<img src='/assets/MobileView.png' />
<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(255,0,0,0.2)' }}>
  > **_NOTE:_** You will only see this button on **Editor Mode**.
</div>

## Props

#### `mobileView`

- **Definition**: `mobileView` is a configuration setting that determines how the application should be displayed on mobile devices. It can have different values, such as 'iframe' or 'container', which specify different rendering modes.
- **Usage**: This setting is typically passed as a prop to components that need to adjust their behavior or layout based on the device type. In our Lumina component, it is part of the config prop.
- **Purpose**: The purpose of `mobileView` is to provide flexibility in how the application adapts to mobile devices.

#### `isMobile`

- **Definition**: `isMobile` is a boolean value that indicates whether the application is currently being viewed on a mobile device.
- **Usage**: This value is stored in the application context ( `appContext` ) and can be accessed using the `useAppContext` **hook**. It is used to conditionally render components or apply specific styles based on the device type.
- **Purpose**: The purpose of `isMobile` is to enable responsive design and functionality.

## How to use `mobileView` and `isMobile`

#### 1. Accessing `isMobile`

- In our `MobileViewButton` component, we can access `isMobile` from the `appContext` to determine the current device type.

```tsx
const appContext = useAppContext()
```

#### 2. Toggling

- `isMobile`: The `toggleView` function dispatches an action to update the `isMobile` state in the context. This allows us to switch between mobile and desktop views.

```tsx
const toggleView = () => {
  dispatch({
    type: 'setIsMobile',
    data: !appContext.isMobile,
  })
}
```

#### 3. Conditional Rendering

- We use the `isMobile` value to conditionally set the icon for the button. This ensures that the button reflects the current view mode.

  ```tsx
  <Button
    buttonType='button'
    iconLeft={appContext.isMobile ? 'lum-icon-mobile' : 'lum-icon-mobile'}
    onClick={toggleView}
  />
  ```

```

```
