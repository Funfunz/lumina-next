## Folder Structure

Understanding the folder structure of a project is crucial for navigating and maintaining the codebase efficiently. This section provides an overview of the typical folder structure used in our project.
Our project follows a modular folder structure to keep the code organized and maintainable. Each folder has a specific purpose, and related files are grouped together.

### Root Directory

The root directory contains the main configuration files and entry points for the project.

### /src Directory

The `/src` directory contains the source code of the project. This is where the main application logic resides.

#### /components

The `/components` directory contains reusable UI components.

#### /context

The `/context` directory contains context providers and hooks for managing global state.

#### /pages

The `/pages` directory contains the different pages of the application.

#### /styles

The `/styles` directory contains the global styles and CSS files.

## Branching System

Our project follows a Git-based branching strategy that includes several types of branches, each serving a specific purpose. The main branches are `main`, `develop`, `feature`, `release`, and `hotfix`.

#### main

The `main` branch contains the production-ready code. It should always be stable and deployable. Only thoroughly tested and approved changes are merged into this branch.

#### develop

The `develop` branch serves as the integration branch for features. It contains the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Developers branch off from `develop` to create feature branches and merge back into `develop` when their features are complete.

#### feature

Feature branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. They branch off from `develop` and are merged back into `develop` when the feature is complete.

#### release

Release branches support preparation of a new production release. They allow for last-minute fixes and preparing meta-data for a release. Once ready, release branches are merged into both `main` and `develop`.

#### hotfix

Hotfix branches are used to quickly patch production releases. They branch off from `main` and, once the fix is complete, are merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

#### Documentation

Used for documentation for the project

### Example

Creating a Hotfix Branch:
Branch off from main.
Implement the hotfix.
Merge into both main and develop and delete the hotfix branch.

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/hotfix-name

# Implement hotfix

git add .
git commit -m "Fix issue description"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/hotfix-name
git push origin main
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/hotfix-name
git push origin develop
git branch -d hotfix/hotfix-name
