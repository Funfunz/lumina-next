# React Hook Form

## Concept

`React Hook Form`, or `RHF` for short, is a library based on `hooks` that we will be using for **input validation** for all forms components that we have (**when needed**). This has to applied on each component use case when needed, and example would be a `Login` (**which I have left that example in this Storybook**)

You can learn more **@[React Hook Form official website](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started)**

## Imports

Use `import { SubmitHandler, useForm } from 'react-hook-form'` to start working with RHF Library.

## Main Props

- `...register` Is used to connect a property in the input field to be registered on submission of a Form.
  - `{required: true OR required: "error message here"}` which will avoid the submission of the form.
  - `pattern`for example `pattern: /^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}$/,` which will make sure that the an email input for example field follows it.
  - Additionally, you can also add `minLength` where you define the minimum number of characters for an input field.
  - `validate` can take a function, for example `validate: (value) => value.includes('@')` to validate the input field.
- `handleSubmit` It will prevent the default behavior from the form, and does the work of validating the handler (which will be an argument for the function from RHF)
- `formState: { errors }` is another function that takes an object `errors` for error message on validation. For the error message itself, it will be on the `required: "error message here"` that this will work, as mentioned above. For `minLength` we can extend it as follows, `minLength: { value : 8, message: 'insert message here'}`

  - Still inside `formState` we can also add `isSubmitting` when we want to use an async function when the form is submitting to the backend. This can be used for example on the submit button, `<button disable={isSubmitting} type='submit'>Submit</button>` in this case the button will be disabled while is submiting the form.

## Usage example

Invoke the hook as follows

```tsx
const form = useForm()
```

After that we can destructure the `form` into other properties as shown below

```tsx
const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  setError,
  formState: { errors, isSubmitting },
} = useForm <
TProps >
{
  mode: 'onChange',
}
```

A small code snippet for usage context

```tsx
<Input
  {...register('email', {
    required: 'Email is required',
    pattern: {
      value: /^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}$/,
      message: 'Please input a valid email',
    },
  })}
  label='Email'
  type='email'
  placeholder='Email'
/>
```

On the **`Login Example`**, I will leave the whole code for a normal login form to be rendered with validation.
