# Required data structure

The **Data fetcher** makes a request to the server and retrieves the page structure.

This page structure is then transformed into the bellow format and passed into the **Component Renderer**.

```ts
export interface IData {
  [key: string]: IPageData
}

export interface IPageData {
  id: string
  friendlyName: string
  description: string
  dateModified: string
  status: string
  children?: IComponentData[]
  props?: IPageProps
  route: string
  isMatch?: boolean
}

export interface IComponentData {
  type: string
  id: string
  friendlyName: string
  order: number
  children?: IComponentData[]
  props?: IComponentProps
  hidden?: boolean
  hasFilterChildren?: boolean
  isMatch?: boolean
}

export interface IComponentProps {
  [key: string]: string | number | boolean | undefined
}

export interface IPageProps {
  [key: string]: string | number | boolean | undefined
}
```

### Example data

```ts
import { IData } from '@lumina/core'

export const data: IData = {
  ['/']: {
    id: 'page1',
    friendlyName: 'Homepage',
    description: 'Homepage for Lumina Page Builder',
    dateModified: '18.06.2024',
    status: 'active',
    route: '/',
    children: [
      {
        id: 'container_dr1ipftw91',
        type: 'container',
        friendlyName: 'MainContainer',
        order: 1,
        hidden: false,
        props: {},
        children: [
          {
            id: 'spacer_4z4da61m96',
            type: 'spacer',
            friendlyName: 'spacer1',
            children: [],
            order: 1,
            hidden: false,
            props: {
              size: 4,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```
